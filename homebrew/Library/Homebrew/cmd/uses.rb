        `uses` [<options>] <formula>

        Show formulae that specify <formula> as a dependency (i.e. show dependents
        of <formula>). When given multiple formula arguments, show the intersection
        of formulae that use <formula>. By default, `uses` shows all formulae that
        specify <formula> as a required or recommended dependency for their stable builds.
