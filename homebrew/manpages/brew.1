.br
\fBbrew\fR \fIcommand\fR [\fB\-\-verbose\fR|\fB\-v\fR] [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIformula\fR] \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with macOS\.
.
.SH "ESSENTIAL COMMANDS"
For the full command list, see the \fICOMMANDS\fR section\.
.
.P
With \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-\-debug\fR, many commands print extra debugging information\. Note that these options should only appear after a command\.
.
.SS "\fBinstall\fR \fIformula\fR:"
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.P
\fIformula\fR is usually the name of the formula to install, but it has other syntaxes which are listed in the \fISPECIFYING FORMULAE\fR section\.
.
.SS "\fBuninstall\fR \fIformula\fR:"
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.SS "\fBlist\fR:"
List all installed formulae\.
.
.SS "\fBsearch\fR (\fItext\fR|\fB/\fR\fItext\fR\fB/\fR):"
Perform a substring search of cask tokens and formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression\. The search for \fItext\fR is extended online to \fBhomebrew/core\fR and \fBhomebrew/cask\fR\. If no search term is provided, all locally available formulae are listed\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.SS "\fBanalytics\fR [\fIsubcommand\fR]"

.P
The variables \fBHOMEBREW_PREFIX\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_CELLAR\fR and \fBHOMEBREW_REPOSITORY\fR are also exported to avoid querying them multiple times\. Consider adding evaluation of this command\'s output to your dotfiles (e\.g\. \fB~/\.profile\fR, \fB~/\.bash_profile\fR, or \fB~/\.zprofile\fR) with: \fBeval $(brew shellenv)\fR
.

Tap a formula repository\.
.
.P
If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps\.
.
.P
With \fIURL\fR unspecified, tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBbrew tap\fR \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR \fBhttps://github\.com/\fR\fIuser\fR\fB/homebrew\-\fR\fIrepo\fR\.
.
.P
With \fIURL\fR specified, tap a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR(1) handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\. This two\-argument command makes no assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e\.g\. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-full\fR
Convert a shallow clone to a full clone without untapping\. Taps are only cloned as shallow clones on continuous integration, or if \fB\-\-shallow\fR was originally passed\.

.
.TP
\fB\-\-repair\fR
Migrate tapped formulae from symlink\-based to directory\-based structure\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-pinned\fR

Bundler for non\-Ruby dependencies from Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, Mac App Store and Whalebrew\.
.
.P
\fBbrew bundle\fR [\fBinstall\fR]
    Install and upgrade (by default) all dependencies from the \fBBrewfile\fR\.
.
.P
You can skip the installation of dependencies by adding space\-separated values to one or more of the following environment variables: \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_BREW_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_CASK_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_MAS_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_WHALEBREW_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_TAP_SKIP\fR
.
.P
\fBbrew bundle\fR will output a \fBBrewfile\.lock\.json\fR in the same directory as the \fBBrewfile\fR if all dependencies are installed successfully\. This contains dependency and system status information which can be useful in debugging \fBbrew bundle\fR failures and replicating a "last known good build" state\. You can opt\-out of this behaviour by setting the \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_NO_LOCK\fR environment variable or passing the \fB\-\-no\-lock\fR option\. You may wish to check this file into the same version control system as your \fBBrewfile\fR (or ensure your version control system ignores it if you\'d prefer to rely on debugging information from a local machine)\.

By default, only Homebrew dependencies are listed\.
.
.P
\fBbrew bundle exec\fR \fIcommand\fR
    Run an external command in an isolated build environment based on the \fBBrewfile\fR dependencies\.
.
.P
This sanitized build environment ignores unrequested dependencies, which makes sure that things you didn\'t specify in your \fBBrewfile\fR won\'t get picked up by commands like \fBbundle install\fR, \fBnpm install\fR, etc\. It will also add compiler flags which will help find keg\-only dependencies like \fBopenssl\fR, \fBicu4c\fR, etc\.

Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs: \fIhttps://docs\.brew\.sh/External\-Commands\fR

.SH "SPECIFYING FORMULAE"
Many Homebrew commands accept one or more \fIformula\fR arguments\. These arguments can take several different forms:

The name of a formula
e\.g\. \fBgit\fR, \fBnode\fR, \fBwget\fR\.

The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula
Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in \fBhomebrew/core\fR\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fR or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fR\.
.
.TP
An arbitrary file
Homebrew can install formulae from a local path\. It can point to either a formula file or a bottle\.
